This is a ground station software to be used with my AeroInfoSystem. It is written in Python, with supporting libraries such as wxPython, PyOpenGL and pyserial. Data are transmitted back to the station via a pair of 2.4Ghz telemetry tranceivers, and the MAVLink protocol is used. This software is capable of displaying crucial flight information such as attitude, altitude, airspeed, horizontal position, battery status, etc.
